## Overview of the project

### project   
Create a Java program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.   write objective, key activity, technology  used for the given project

### Objective:
To develop a simple, user-friendly Java program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input. This project demonstrates the use of Java's control structures and basic arithmetic operators to solve a practical problem.

### Key Activities:
Requirement Analysis:

- ** Define the core functionality of the calculator:
input two numbers, select an operation, and display the result.
Handle potential errors like division by zero.

- ** Design:
Create a user-friendly command-line interface to take inputs from the user.
Design a logical flow for processing user input and displaying results.

- ** Implementation:
Use Java programming constructs such as Scanner for input and switch or if-else for operation selection.
Perform arithmetic operations and return results to the user.

- ** Testing:
Test the program with various inputs to ensure correct results.
Test edge cases like zero input or invalid operation selections.

- ** Documentation:
Provide comments in the code to explain the logic.
Create a simple user manual for the program usage.

### Technology Used:
Programming Language: Java
Java Standard Library: java.util.Scanner for user input handling.
